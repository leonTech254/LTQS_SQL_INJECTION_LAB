        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in the way that databases are constructed and interacted with. Essentially, an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a database query, allowing them to gain access to sensitive information or manipulate data stored within the database.
<br> <br>
Therefor LEONTEQSECURITY have come up with this project which aims to create a safe and controlled environment for individuals to practice and improve their skills in identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities. As an open-source project, the lab is freely accessible to anyone who is interested in learning more about SQL injection, and the community of contributors is constantly working to keep the lab up-to-date and relevant.
<br> <br>
While the lab is currently under development, the team behind the project is working hard to ensure that it provides a comprehensive and engaging learning experience for those looking to gain proficiency in SQL injection. Whether you are a security professional, a student, or simply someone with a passion for cybersecurity, this project is designed to help you expand your skills and understanding of SQL injection and its potential impact.
